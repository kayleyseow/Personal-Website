      <b>✨What's a failure résumé?</b>
      <br />
      → A failure résumé is known by many names: anti-resume, anti-portfolio, or
      CV of failures. The overarching idea is the same, though. By keeping track
      of your failures and reflecting on them in a way that's constructive, you
      can learn from your mistakes and achieve more in the future.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>✨Why did you decide to make one?</b>
      <br />
      → I decided to make a "failure resume" because I feel its important for me
      to be able to look at my past failures in a positive light, and be able to
      learn from them at the same time.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>✨Fun Fact:</b> The idea of an "anti-resume" actually originated from
      acedemia!
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>✨Fun Fact 2:</b> The word "unfortunately" is mentioned in my email
      inbox an astounding <b>83</b> times! (not all are rejections, though...)
