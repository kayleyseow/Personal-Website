# Personal Website Starter Project

This is a place for you to start building your first project -- your personal website!

## Project Requirements
Your project should:
- Include one "Home" HTML page (that will be index.html) that's all about you!
- Include one "Portfolio" HTML page that will showcase the projects you build in class.
- Include a navigation bar that is included on all your website's pages.
- Have all text, image(s), links, and/or videos on the page contained within appropriate HTML elements.

## Extensions
You can extend your project further by:
- Creating a "Blog" HTML page that you can use to write blog posts with your readers!
- Adding accessibility features to your website.

# Starter Code File Overview

Your full activity instructions are in HQ, but here's a little cheat-sheet of the files in this project:

## ← index.html

This is your homepage. It should be the first page that you work on.

## ← portfolio.html
This will be your portfolio page.  

## ← script.js

Later this week, you'll get fancy with the ability to add interactivity to your site with JavaScript. For now, there's no need to edit this file!

## ← styles.css

The file for your styles! You don't need to worry about editing this file right now. You'll learn more about CSS styling tomorrow.
